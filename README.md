
Hello

This quiz app is essentially divided into 6 different .java files.

-Question.java is the class for the questions containing as attributes
Subject,Question,Option1,Option2,Option3,Option4,The Right Awnser,
and the awnser given by the user

-CSV_Reader is a class that reads and contains the Questions.csv file where all questions are located,
each question holds 8 parts delimited by a ',' and questions are separated by ';' CSV_Reader also shuffles
questions before feeding it to the program

-Welcome_Screen is the main frame to be loaded at the beguinning of the program to acquire the user's name
and desired subject

-Question_Screen is the panel containing the question set where the user takes the actual test, there are 
10 questions placed per session, randomly shuffled each time

-Result_page marks the end of the program where the user is presented with his result and all right/wrong questions

-app.java creates an instance of the program.

Ive decided to choose a pastel color palette since it is easy on the eyes and a calming color palette, it is also my favorite.

Run the app by running app.java and enjoy (Hopefully)

Thanks for reading and Enjoy!
